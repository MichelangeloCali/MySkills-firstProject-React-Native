# My Skills - App Mobile 

The My Skills App is my first project using React Native. The intention was to develop a simple application where I could use the framework in a basic way.

# Usefulness of the App
The App is simple and easy to use and extremely intuitive. The idea is for the user to add a list of ''skills'' he has, and the item can be deleted when clicked. The application can also be used for reminders, since it has good functionality for this purpose.

# How was it developed?
The App was developed using the React Native framework and Android Studio emulator. Typescript was used for static typing and basic form css with style sheet imported module. The application was developed in a basic way in order to learn the framework and its features.
